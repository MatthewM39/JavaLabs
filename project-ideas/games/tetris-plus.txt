So I had this wierd idea for a Tetris Game clone..except a Tetris game with rogue elements, such as inanimate objects either trying to 
fill up the tetris piece space or trying to kill the player somehow.   I would call this "Ganon's Magical Tetris Challenge.

Story time.

So one day Ganon had finally got fed up with Link saving the land of Hyrule with the magic triforce pieces....EVERYTIME, so He gave up on his
way of evil and retreated back to his house, hidden in the clouds, since his other house was forfeited due to non-payment of 100,000 rupees per week.
So Ganon went into his basement and found an old arcade machine that he stole from the arcade place since he was a kid, plugged in some batteries and done,
the machine begins to whine, and as soon as the little pieces start falling from the top, he begins to place them in random spots, only to find out that
there are other objects that are trying to ruin his game!  Such as pots, scissors, and others, including pizza and apple pie, who murdered his dog
on christmas eve.   So now Ganon must save the world from Ice Cream and apple pie.....by playing Tetris.   In his basement.


As i said before, the game play remains the same....most of the time.   There is also a multiplayer mode that's unlokable by beating link's
score of over nine thousand points.  This is just a presentation of what I have planned if this project is chosen.
