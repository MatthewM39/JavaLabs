Idea: That we develop a -simple- FTP server. So it would require sockets etc, but those are pretty easy to understand.
I think it would be interesting to do because you are basically coding your own server which is, to me at least, really cool.
It should be fairly easy to do as a project, and would be cool to build upon later with a gui and other features like security.
The user should be able to do the following:
	Upload New Files; (I.E. and html or js file)
	Download Files;	(For local usage, including downloading whole folders)
	Replace Files;	(For updating files on the server)
	Open Files Locally; (Edit them locally and, upon saving, update them on the server)
	And Rename/Copy Files; (Rename files on the server and make copies on the server)
All of these are things which I believe to make up the basics of an FTP server.
